  ## Description
  A CMS-style blog, similar to a Wordpress site, where users can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers posts as well. It follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication. It will then be deployed on Heroku.
